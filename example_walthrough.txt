this is a specific walkthrough of how to use git using this gitReadme repo as an example. this repo, its additions and changes were set up in the following way:

*this walthrough assumes that you have already set up a github account and have installed git (and neccessary dependancies) on your computer

to set up the gitReadme repo:
-open terminal
>curl -u 'MSIT-RPC' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"gitReadme"}'
-username: MSIT-RPC, repo: gitReadme
-the repo now exists at https://github.com/MSIT-RPC/gitReadme

to make the gitReadme file(s):
*working in directory Documents/git/gitReadme
>nano gitReadme.txt
-write gitReadme.txt
>git init
>git add .
>git commit -m 'First commit'
>git remote add origin https://github.com/MSIT-RPC/gitReadme
>git remote -v
>git push origin master
-gitReadme.txt is now in the repo gitReadme
-for subsequent changes, you can edit the file locally and then push it to the repo
>nano gitReadme.txt
-edit gitReadme.txt
>git add .
>git commit -m 'subsequent commit message'
>git push origin master
-the new version of gitReadme.txt is now on the repo
-for any subsequent changes, you need only follow add, commit, push
